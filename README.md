# pokedex
Pok√©dex developed on Ionic 5, Angular 9 and RxJs.

Considerations:
  - Reactive architecture using RxJs.
  - Pokemons list was optimized with pagination using "ion-infinite-scroll", and reused cells with "ion-virtual-scroll".
  - Error control.
  - Lazy-load to load pages.
  - Internationalization. It is possible to select english or spanish language in main page.

Development enviroment: 
  - Node: v12.18.2
  - Npm:  v6.14.5
